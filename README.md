<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/IgVincon/error-page-devchallenge/blob/main/images/screenshot-2023-04-24-182717.png)

This is my solution for the 404 Not Found challenge. You can check the full page [here](https://igvincon.github.io/error-page-devchallenge/). This was a fun and challenging experience, even with some prior programming knoweldge, since it was my first time working on frontend web design. 

I had to google my way into learning HTML and CSS coding and naming conventions, responsive web design (flex and grid), webpage layout and even CSS validation. I'm sure there is a lot more to learn and I will keep doing so while advancing with these challenges.
